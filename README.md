# DRAM Price Tracker

A personal static dashboard for tracking DRAM prices from public pages.

## What it tracks

- **TrendForce / DRAMeXchange current spot prices** from the public DRAM spot table.
- **TrendForce / DRAMeXchange current contract prices** from the public contract table.
- **MemoryMarket / CFM weekly spot proxy history** for publicly listed DRAM products, typically the past six months.

The project stores normalized JSON in `data/` and renders a static dashboard from `web/`, so it can run on GitHub Pages without a server.

The dashboard includes source, price-kind, category, product, metric, and explicit chart-series limit controls. Representative products are highlighted by default, and selecting **All products** plus **All matching series** graphs every collected series.

## Local setup

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
PYTHONPATH=src python -m dram_tracker.collect --fixture-dir tests/fixtures --output tmp/test-data
PYTHONPATH=src python -m dram_tracker.collect --output data --limit-products 5
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/web/` after starting the static server.

## Data files

- `data/prices.json` — normalized observations.
- `data/series.json` — product/series metadata and representative defaults.
- `data/status.json` — collection timestamp, source status, counts, and caveats.

Observation fields include `source`, `kind` (`spot`, `contract`, `spot_proxy`), `cadence`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `date`, `effective_date`, `collected_at`, `currency`, and a source-specific `values` object.
When available, observations also include `category` (for example `ddr`, `rdimm`, `sodimm`, `lpddr`, `ddr4`, or `ddr5`) so the dashboard can filter source/category/product independently.

## GitHub Actions automation

Two workflows are included:

- `.github/workflows/update-data.yml` runs a primary daily refresh at `09:20 UTC` (`18:20 KST`) and a next-day backfill check at `21:00 UTC` (`06:00 KST` on the following local day). Manual dispatches always run. The primary scheduled run skips collection when TrendForce daily spot observations already include the current KST date; the 06:00 KST next-day backfill run checks the previous KST date and collects only when that date is missing. A date is treated as collected only when at least two TrendForce daily spot rows exist for that date, and after a live collection the workflow re-checks the requested target date before tests, commit, and deploy. When collection is needed and the target-date verification passes, the workflow runs tests, commits `data/` when data changes, and deploys the refreshed static site to GitHub Pages in the same workflow.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` still publishes `web/` plus `data/` to GitHub Pages for manual dispatches and normal dashboard/data pushes made outside the scheduled bot update path. Scheduled data commits include the explicit `Skip-Pages-Deploy: update-data-workflow` trailer, and `deploy-pages.yml` uses that marker to avoid re-entering a second Pages deploy because `update-data.yml` already deployed the same artifact.

The dashboard also links to the manual **Update DRAM price data** workflow page. A browser button cannot safely trigger collection by itself without exposing a GitHub token, so manual refreshes intentionally require a signed-in GitHub account with repository write access. GitHub Actions runs on GitHub-hosted infrastructure, so the scheduled refresh does not depend on your computer being on or connected to Wi-Fi. To change the primary refresh time, edit the UTC cron expression in `.github/workflows/update-data.yml`; for example, `20 9 * * *` means `18:20 KST`.

To enable Pages, create the repository on GitHub, push this branch, then enable **Settings → Pages → GitHub Actions**.

The project intentionally stores collected observations in committed JSON files rather than relying on only the latest source pages. The daily collector reads the existing `data/prices.json`, merges newly collected rows by `source + kind + product_id + cadence + date`, and writes the normalized result back to `data/`. That means a new day adds a new observation while a repeated scrape of the same source/date updates that row. `series.json` and `status.json` are regenerated from the merged observation set so the dashboard can safely load one static dataset on GitHub Pages.

## Source caveats

- Public TrendForce/DRAMeXchange pages expose current tables; free historical TrendForce/DRAMeXchange data is not assumed.
- MemoryMarket publicly discloses recent weekly history for product pages and states that price data is copyrighted. Use this project for personal tracking/research and review source terms before broad redistribution.
- HTML pages can change. The collector uses a best-effort policy for this personal tracker: parser/source failures are recorded in `data/status.json`, old observations are preserved, and the command exits non-zero only when every source fails and no stored observations remain. TrendForce rows require a source update timestamp; missing source date metadata is treated as a source failure instead of inventing an effective date. The next-day backfill check can only collect data that the public sources still expose; it does not fabricate missing historical TrendForce rows. If the requested date is still missing after collection, the scheduled workflow fails before commit/deploy instead of publishing a misleading freshness timestamp.

## Representative defaults

The dashboard highlights common series such as DDR5 16Gb, DDR4 16Gb 3200, DDR4 8Gb 3200, and key SO-DIMM contract rows when available. All collected products remain selectable.
